This error occurs when you use a state variable in a component's render method without using the functional component's useState hook or the class component's setState method.  This will lead to unexpected behavior and render performance issues as the component will not re-render when the state changes. For example, if you directly access a variable which you intended to be a state variable outside the useState hook, the component will not update, leading to stale closures.

```javascript
//Incorrect
function MyComponent() {
  let count = 0;
  const increment = () => {
    count++;
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
